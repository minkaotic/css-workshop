# Understanding Display Modes

The [`display`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) mode of a HTML element significantly affects *how we go about* positioning it!

The most common values are:
```css
display: block;
display: inline;
display: inline-block;
display: none;  // remove element from document flow
display: flex;  // we'll discuss this one later
display: grid;  // not part of this workshop
```

### All HTML elements have a default

| Block            | Inline     | Inline-block  |
|------------------|------------|---------------|
| `h1`, `h2`, etc. | `span`     | `img`         |
| `p`              | `a`        |               |
| `div`            | plain text |               |
| `ol`/`ul`/`li`   |            |               |

- `block` elements span the entire width of their container, forcing all subsequent elements to the next line
- `inline` elements  only span the width of their contents, allowing any inline level element to flow up next to it on the same line
  - ðŸ”¥ ***NB:** width and height properties, or top/bottom margin or padding settings won't be applied to inline elements*; only left/right margins and padding will work.
- `inline-block` allows elements to flow next to it, but allows to set width/height and top/bottom margins and padding are respected.

> ðŸ’¡ **Changing the default display mode of an element with CSS is better than using a less semantically appropriate element to achieve a visual result!**

### Centring items
- To centre inline-elements inside an element, use `text-align: center;`
- To horizontally centre a block element, use `margin: auto;` combined with setting a `width`!

## Task!
ðŸ’ª **Write the CSS for the top level layout structure**

- Take a look at the design: we can see that all 3 of our high level `<divs>` are supposed to have the same width and be centred on the page:

- Rather than repeating the rules for each `<div>`, this is usually achieved by applying them to a wrapper element - for this exercise, we can use our app's `#root` div for this purpose. Use it to centre the content & give it a width!

- Lets give the `search-bar` and `search-result-card` a different background colour, and set a border radius

- Set a sensible top and bottom margin for our `#root` wrapper

- get the 'devfinder' headline and 'LIGHT' mode switch to display alongside each other by changing the display mode

# Different Layout Techniques & When To Use Them

## Harnessing display modes
- (as discussed in previous lesson!)
- can be used to organise elements next to each other or above one another

## Floats
- `float`ing an element takes it out of the normal page flow, placing it either to the left or right of a container, and causing other elements to flow around it

**Use cases:**
- wrapping text around images in an article or blog post
- floating content columns within a container

**Downsides:**
- if a block element contains floated children, its height will collapse (unless they have a fixed height value set, which isn't practical in responsive design), causing elements to overlap where they shouldn't...

- this is commonly addressed with a "clearfix" (below), but is noisy

    ```css
    [parent selector]::after {
    content: "";
    display: table;
    clear: both;
    }
    ```

## CSS Positioning
Another way to take elements out of the default page flow and position them on the page, is by manipulating the CSS [`position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) property.

This is a massive subject beyond the scope of this workshop, but recommended further reading:

## Flexbox
Neither display mode manipulation, nor floats, nor absolute positioning were originally designed to handle the layout demands of todayâ€™s complex responsive websites.

By contrast, **flexbox is a collection of CSS properties that were specifically designed to meet this challenge**, i.e.:

- lay out a collection of items in one direction or another
- control the dimensions of the items
- and control the spacing between items

## CSS Grid
Is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system. Like flexbox, it was specifically developed as a layout system to replace the flawed approaches of the past.

It has [slightly different use cases](https://css-tricks.com/quick-whats-the-difference-between-flexbox-and-grid/) than flexbox, so can be used as an alternative - although they can also be used together!

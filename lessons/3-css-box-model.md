# The CSS Box Model

![CSS box model diagram](https://github.com/minkaotic/front-end-notes/blob/master/img/box_model.png?raw=true)

- `padding` = gap from border of the container to the *inner contents*
- `margin` = gap from border of the container to the other elements *around it*

> ðŸ”¥ **NOTE: `width` generally applies only to the *content* of the box, i.e. not including its padding and border!** (To flip this behaviour around, use `box-sizing: border-box;` - this dynamically subtracts the borders and paddings from the width/height properties we set, esp. useful when defining dimensions relative to parent containers etc.)

### Max- and min-width/height
- TO DO!

### Common units for dimensions
Values provided in `px` are absolute, but there are also a number of **useful relative units**, which are key for responsive design:
- `em` - relative to parent's pixel size; and default to 16px at root
- `rem` - relative to root elemen's pixel size, thus avoiding compounding issues
- `%` - always relative to parent container; setting border radius to 50% will make a rectangual element completely round / elliptical
- `vh`/`vw` - relative to viewport (=screen); common use case: filling the page even when there is little content by setting `min-height: 100vh;`

### The `calc()` function
- does the maths for you! Different types of units can be mixed (%, vh, px, em etc.)
- e.g. `calc(100% - 180px)` to make an element flexibly take up all the space next to a fixed-width element

Can be useful in conjunction with SASS variables to express intent:

```scss
$button-width: 200px;

.button {
    width: $button-width;
}

.content {
    width: calc(100% - $button-width);
}
```

### Why margins collapse
The element size calculated by the browser only takes into account content, padding and border, *but not margin.* If there is no content, padding, or border area to interrupt two vertically touching margins, [the margins collapse to the largest of the two margin values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Mastering_margin_collapsing).
- Collapsed margins can even end up outside the parent!
- **Only vertical margins are affected by this** - horizontal margins do not collapse


## Task!
ðŸ’ª **Finetune the layout of the high-level elements**
> ðŸ’¡ Use SASS variables to express intent and avoid repeating selectors uneccesarily.

1. Let's give the `search-bar` and `search-result-card` sensible padding and a border radius.

1. Make the user image appear round (hint: use `border-radius`), and give it some right margin.

1. Set the `#root` width as a `%` or `vw` value so its somewhat responsive. Set a `max-width` that it shouldn't cross beyond on large screens.

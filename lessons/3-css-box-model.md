# The CSS Box Model

- common units
  - setting wrapper width as a % rather than pixel is a cheap way to make it responsive
  - vh use case: filling the page by setting height to 100vh


width vs max-width etc.


## Task!
ðŸ’ª **Finetune the layout of the high-level elements**

  1. Lets give the `search-bar` and `search-result-card` sensible padding, margins and a border radius.

  1. Set the `#root` width as a `%` value so its somewhat responsive. Set a `max-width` that it shouldn't cross beyond on large screens.

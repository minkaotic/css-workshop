# CSS Workshop

Looking at the task to create a 'GitHub user search' UI, we'll explore a number of important concepts and techniques for laying out and aligning things in CSS.
Task link on Frontend Mentor: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/github-user-search-app-Q09YOgaH6

## Setup
1. Clone this repo and `cd github-user-search`
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm run dev` to run the app locally

## Approach
Approaching things in the following order allows us to gather feedback from product early - a static UI demonstrates what the app _would/could_ do - and helps us iron out any questions or unclear requirements before getting too far down the line of writing the implementation.

1. Break the design into pieces
1. Build a static UI (with stub data)
1. Implement behaviours of the app
    - Add state to allow for interactivity
    - Get real data from the backend

The [official React guidelines](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react) also recommend this approach.

> ðŸ’¡ This workshop will only focus on the first 2 steps!

## But first, some theory...
